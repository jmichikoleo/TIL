# 260210 Coding Test 

---
## Problem Definition 
> We are given integers a and b. Write a code that takes each number and outputs it in the same format as in the input-output example
> Restrictions : -100,000 < a , b >= 100,000

Input Example : 
  > 4 5


Output Example :
  > a = 4

  > b = 5

## Progress Method 
- a,b from the input has to be change into integer first since every input is considered a string.
- then we need to split a and b by removing the space.
- and then each one should be printed out separately

## Code : 
> a, b = map(int, input().split(' '))

> print("a =",a)

> print("b =",b)

## Results : 
if the input was 4 5, then the output is a = 4 b = 5.
